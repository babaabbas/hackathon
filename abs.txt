IT WORKS
HOW
Traditional programmatic advertising has inherent limitations, requiring the duplication of processes across all stakeholders. This inefficiency is unsustainable. Alkimi streamlines your operations, providing access to comprehensive data on ad tracking, placement, revenue, fees, and impressions, all within a unified platform. We aim to enhance the economic viability of quality advertising.
